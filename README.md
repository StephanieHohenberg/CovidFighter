# CovidFighter
With CovidFighter people, who got tested positive of Covid19, have the opportunity to warn strangers, who they might have infected, simply by sharing their geo data anonymously. This could stop the spread of the virus, break the infection chain and support an anonymous contact tracking.


## How to use it as someone tested positive
First step:
Reflect, where you have been before gotten tested positive and before staying in quarantine. Use [Google Timelines](http://maps.google.com/maps/timeline) to create your geodata. Add the locations with an approximately timeframe to the map. After adding all your locations for all the relevant days, go to the settings and export the data for each day into a kml file.

Second step:
Open the CovidFighter Webapp in your favourite browser and upload these kml-files. You need to log in with a Google Account to use the webapp. 
( We do not save your any of your account data. It is due to security reasons for the database. Feel free to create a new google account, if you feel more comfy with it. )

Third step:
Share this app with your friends. As more people know this webapp, as more people can check, whether they might have met someone tested positive and as more people tested positve can upload their geodata. #ShareTheWord #StopTheSpread


## How to use it as someone not tested
First step:
Open the CovidFighter Webapp in your favourite browser and track whether you might have been in contact with someone tested positive. 
Have you been to any of the displayed locations in the map? Click on the pin to compare the time.

You need to log in with a Google Account to use the webapp. ( We do not save your any of your account data. It is due to security reasons for the database. Feel free to create a new google account, if you feel more comfy with it. )

Second step:
You need to consider by yourself depending on the situation, whether you act on it.
Do you feel sick? Do you have symptons? Maybe do a test or stay home for a couple of days.

In case you got tested positive, share your geodata in the CovidFighter Webapp and break the chain.

Third step:
Share this app with your friends. As more people know this webapp, as more people can check, whether they might have met someone tested positive and as more people tested positve can upload their geodata. #ShareTheWord #StopTheSpread


## Side Notes
This is not a replacement of the Corona-Warn-App of the Deutsche Bundesregierung, but an addition. It is an experiment to solve the pandemic by data, by sharing anonymous geo data with your local community. Currently it is in an experimental phase and just supports locations in Berlin.

In the Corona-Warn-App users can not see the collected data and also can not add data afterwards, after they have visited locations without turned on Bluetooth or after getting tested positive. It just enabled contact tracking, if people have the app downloaded and actively use it by turning on the bluetooth.
In the Covid Fighter WebApp the users don't get tracked by the app. The users need to track manually by themselves, whether they have been in contact with someone tested positive by analyzing the locations displayed on the map. The displayed locations are uploaded by users tested positive. Users can create and therefore see their own geo data and share it anonymously. Of course all the data will be deleted after 14 days.
